            <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Workers affiliated with Teamsters Local 283 have initiated a strike to demand
        improved wages and safer working conditions at Marathon Petroleum’s refinery 
        located in Detroit. The strike highlights the employees' concerns regarding their
        compensation and the health and safety standards at the facility, which they believe
        e insufficient. <br><br>In response to the labor action, Marathon Petroleum has decided to hire
        temporary workers at double the usual pay rate. However, this solution has raised
        significant concerns, as these temporary workers are being brought on with a notably 
        inadequate level of training, potentially jeopardizing both their safety and the 
        operational integrity of the refinery.
      </p><hr>
      <h3>Why this is <strong>dangerous</strong></h3>
      
      <p>
        Workers with more than 2 years of experience are required to hold
        high-pressure licenses. Although these temporary hires are working under
        licensed engineers, the absence of properly credentialed and trained
        staff creates serious safety risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Workers on strike were trained for 1 year</strong>
        initially, and the vast majority hold high-pressure licenses.
        <strong> Now, almost everyone is working without a license</strong>, not
        just a few new people.
      </p>
